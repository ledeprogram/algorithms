#Feature Engineering - Important Factors
--

+ The data you’re using
--

+ The domain you’re working in
--

+ The models you’re working with

---

# Feature Engineering - Strategies
--

+ Use integers to encode features (dummy variables)

![img-center-80](../images/feature1.png)
--

+ Discretize continuous values
--

+ Create dummy variables (but be sure to leave one out)
--

+ Transform values to a standard range (ex. 0 to 1)

---

# Transforming values example

```python
from sklearn import preprocessing

x = df[['Height','Weight']].values #returns a numpy array
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
x_scaled = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(x)

```
---

#Dummy Variable Trap
--

+ Encoding each category of a variable will create variables that are highly correlated 
--

+ This is because they're encoding the same attribute
--

+ This will distort the result
--

+ Dropping one of the dummy variables **should** get you out of the trap
--

+ Assuming every other variable is truly independent

#Linear regression vs classification
--

+ Linear Regression -> predict continuous ordinal value
--

+ Classification -> predict discrete categorical value

---

class:center,middle
#Let's try another way of classifying instances

---

#First of all, some terms
--

+ "instances" -> an occurance (row) in our data
--

+ "features" -> the attributes associated with each instance used to predict some value
--

+ "target variable" -> the class we're trying to predict
--

+ "classifier" -> the model we're using to classify instances

---

#Decision Trees
+ Intuition: Create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features

#Decision Trees
--

+ These are usually made by hand
--

+ We can have a computer calculate the best splits using a "greedy" model that strives for purity at each cut
--

+ Which of these cuts gives us a more pure cut between Class 0 (`C0`) and Class 1 (`C1`)?

#Decision Trees - Iris Dataset
--
![img-right-40](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/assets/MLimages/Large53.jpg)
+ 50 instances based on measurements of an iris plant
--

+ The measured attributes include sepal width and sepal length
--

+ 3 classes of iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica)
--

+ The goal is to classify each iris into the right category (`DecisionTree.ipynb`)

---

#Supervised Learning
--

+ The target value (y) is known in advance
+ Example: # of borrowers who default on their loan
--

+ We use the relationship between the features (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>) and the target value for instances where y is known to create a predictor
--

+ We can use that predictor for instances were y isn't known
--

+ This is called [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) and yields a highly probable result

#But how good is this predictor?

---

#Validating the model
--

+ We can estimate how good our model will do by testing it with labeled data not used to create the model
--

+ A **training set** is used to build the model
--

+ A **test set** is used to determine the accuracy of the model on unseen data
--

+ Usually, the given data set is divided into training and test sets, with training set used to build the model and test set used to validate it
--

+ A **validation set** is another data set that can additionally be used to test the model

---

# Validating the model
+ We use several different measures to tell us how good our model is at it's task
--

+ Accuracy -> What percentage did it get right?
--

+ Precision -> How reliable is the estimate (correctly predicted a class)
--

+ Recall -> How well did it classify the items in the class
