#Algorithms
##Richard Dunks, Instructor
##Submitting Assignments with Github

---

#Setting up the `upstream` master

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ledeprogram/algorithms.git
```
--

##You should now have an origin and an upstream remote

```bash
git remote -v #checks for the remotes
```
![img-center-100](../images/github_remote_check.png)

---

#When you start an assignment or want to refresh the code

```bash
git checkout gh-pages #checkout your local gh-pages branch
git fetch upstream #fetches changes to the upstream repository into your local gh-pages
git merge upstream/gh-pages #merges the changes with the upstream gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages #pushes the merged version to the remote (origin) repository
```
---

#Create a branch to work in
+ `git checkout -b <branch_name>` creates a new branch locally
+ For assignments, name your branch `<github_username>_assignment_<number>`
+ For do nows, name your branch `<github_username>_donow_<number>`
+ When you `git push`, you'll get an error telling you to set the branch
+ `git push --set-upstream <branch_name>`

---

#Make your changes and commit the result
+ `git status` will show the tracked files that have changes and the untracked files (see [the docs for more info](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository))
+ `git add <filename>` the file you want to commit changes of
+ .red[Don't use `git add .`]
+ `git commit -m'my commit message'` to commit the changes
+ `git push` to push changes to **your** remote repository

---

# Key things
+ If you're using an example `.ipynb` file, create a duplicate, don't rename it
+ Name your file properly
+ `<last>_<first>_<class_num>_<assign_numb>.ipynb`
+ Ex. `dunks_richard_1_1.ipynb`
+ .red[If you don't label it right, you didn't do it]

#Make sure 
![img-center-100](../images/github_pull2_box.png)
+ Base fork is `ledeprogram/algorithms` and base is `gh-pages`
+ Can merge out of your branch (don't have to merge with your `gh-pages` before opening a PR)

#Notes on your pull requests
+ Briefly describe any issues, concerns, or questions you had
+ Feel free to provide feedback on the assignments
+ Tag me ([@datapolitan](https://github.com/datapolitan)) or the TAs ([@rashidakamal](https://github.com/rashidakamal) / [@bisaha](https://github.com/bisaha)) if you have anything you want us to flag and look at
