#Assignment Review

---

#Assignment 1
+ Implement the sorting algorithm you came up with in pseudocode with Python
+ Test the sorting algorithm with a list of 10, 100, 1000 random numbers and compare the result using the [`%time`](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html#magic-time) to time your code and submit your results in [code comments](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/comments/comments-in-python)

---

#Assignment 2
+ Implement the search algorithm you came up with in pseudocode with Python
+ Test the search algorithm with a list of 10,100,1000 random numbers (sorted with your sorting algorithm) and compare the result using the [`%time`](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html#magic-time) to time your code and submit your results in [code comments](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/comments/comments-in-python)

> We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.

##Rutherford D. Roger

---

#Why Statistics?
--

+ Tools for extracting meaning from data
--

+ Commonly understood ways of communicating meaning to others

---

#Histogram
--

+ Charts the frequency of instances in the data
--

+ Shows the frequency distribution
--

+ Values are grouped into class intervals
--

+ Best to have a consistent size to class intervals
--

#Read in the data from the class
```pandas
import pandas as pd
%matplotlib inline

df = pd.read_csv("Data_Collection_Sheet.csv")
```
---

#Generate a histogram in Python

```pandas
df.hist()
```

##Check out the [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html)

#Generate a histogram in Python

```python
df["height (inches)"].hist(bins=20)

#Distributions of Data

---

#Normal Distribution
![img-center-80](../images/dist_normal.png)

---

#Long-tail Distribution
![img-center-80](../images/dist_lt.png)

---

#Bi-Modal Distribution
![img-center-100](../images/dist_bm.png)

---

#Mean
--

+ A representative value for the data
--

+ Usually what people mean by “average”
--

+ Calculate by adding all the values together and dividing by the number instances
--

+ Sensitive to extremes
--


```python
df.mean()
```
--

```
height (inches)                 66.623477
age (years)                     29.500000
siblings (not including you)     1.500000
dtype: float64
```
---

#Median
--

+ The “middle” value of a data set
--

+ Center value of a data set with an odd number of values
--

+ Sum of two middle values divided by 2 if the number of items in a data set is even
--

+ Resistant to extreme values
--

![img-center-100](../images/median_balance.png)

--

```python
df.median()
```
---

#Median vs Mean
![img-center-100](../images/mean_vs_median.png)

####Mean
```
height (inches)                 66.623477
age (years)                     29.500000
siblings (not including you)     1.500000
```
####Median
```
height (inches)                 66.5
age (years)                     27.0
siblings (not including you)     1.0
```
---

#Mode
--

+ The most frequent value in a dataset
--

+ Often used for categorical data
![img-right-50](../images/mode.png)

--

```python
df.mode()
```

---

#Measures of Central Tendency
--

+ Quantitative data tends to cluster around some central value
--

+ Contrasts with the spread of data around that center (i.e. the variability in the data)
--

+ Mean is a more precise measure and more often used
--

+ Median is better when there are extreme outliers
--

+ Mode is used when the data is categorical (as opposed to numeric)

---

class:center,middle
#Measuring Variability

---

#Range
--

+ The gap between the minimum value and the maximum value
--

+ Calculated by subtracting the minimum from the maximum
--

```python
df["height (inches)"].max() - df["height (inches)"].min()
```

---

#Quantiles
--

+ Median splits the data set into two equal groups
--

+ Quartiles split the data into four equal groups
--

+ First quartile is 0-25% of the data
--

+ Second quartile is 25-50% of the data
--

+ Third quartile is 50-75% of the data
--

+ Fourth quartile is 75-100% of the data
--

```python
df.quantile(q=0.25) #1st Quartile
df.quantile(q=0.5) #2nd Quartile (Median)
df.quantile(q=0.75) #3rd Quartile
```
---

#Interquartile Range
--

+ “Middle” 50% of data (between 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile)
--

![img-center-80](../images/iqr.png)

---

#Outliers
--

+ Any data points less than 1.5x the IQR or greater than 1.5x the IQR are considered outliers
--

+ Helps identify data points that may skew the analysis
--

+ Focus on the “meat” of the data

---

#Outliers

---

#Standard Deviation
--

+ The average distance of each data point from the mean
--

+ Larger the standard deviation, the greater the spread
--

![img-center-100](../images/std1.png)
--

```python
df.std()
```
```
height (inches)                 3.239595
age (years)                     7.676495
siblings (not including you)    1.057850
```

#Measures of Variability
--

+ Describe the distribution of our data
--

+ Range (Maximum – Minimum)
--

+ Inter-quartile Range
--

+ Standard Deviation
--

+ Identification of outliers (1.5 x IQR)

---

#Descriptive Statistics
--

+ Quantitatively describe the main features of a dataset
--

+ Help distinguish distributions and make them comparable

---

#Exploratory Data Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers

#Correlations
![img-center-100](../images/corr1.png)
###How do we measure this relationship?

---

#Coefficient of Correlation

---

#Coefficient of Correlation
+ Quantifies the amount of shared variability between variables

---

#Coefficient of Correlation
+ Quantifies the amount of shared variability between variables
+ Ranges between -1 and +1 

---

#Coefficient of Correlation
+ Quantifies the amount of shared variability between variables
+ Ranges between -1 and +1 
+ Negative numbers are inversely proportional

---

#Coefficient of Correlation
+ Quantifies the amount of shared variability between variables
+ Ranges between -1 and +1 
+ Negative numbers are inversely proportional
+ Positive numbers are directly proportional

---

#Coefficient of Correlation
+ Quantifies the amount of shared variability between variables
+ Ranges between -1 and +1 
+ Negative numbers are inversely proportional
+ Positive numbers are directly proportional
+ The closer to either -1 or +1, the greater the correlation
