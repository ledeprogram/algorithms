--

+ `git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>` creates branch on remote (git will prompt you if you forget, I always do)
--

+ `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to an existing branch

---

#Create your assignment 3 branch
+ `git checkout -b <github_username>_assignment_3`
+ Make a simple commit in the homework folder
+ `git push --set-upstream origin <github_username>_assignment_3`

---

#Notes on your pull requests
--

+ Briefly describe any issues, concerns, or questions you had
--

+ Feel free to provide feedback on the assignments
--

+ Tag me ([@datapolitan](https://github.com/datapolitan)) or the TAs ([@rashidakamal](https://github.com/rashidakamal) / [@bisaha](https://github.com/bisaha)) if you have anything you want us to look at

#Control Flow Review

---

#Control Statements
--

+ Manages order of program operation
--

+ Helps program make a decision based on conditions
--

+ Any computable operation can be replicated with a mix of three control statements (sequence, selection, and iteration)

---

#Sequence
--

+ The order of functions in a program
--

+ Most basic form of control flow
--

+ Basically the thing you've been doing this whole time

---

#Conditional statement (selection)
--

+ Code block only executes if some logical test is met
--

+ Logical test can be as simple or complex as necessary
--

+ Uses [Boolean logic](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex28.html)

---

#Conditional statement in Python (selection)

+ `if <logical test>:` code executes only if the logical test is `True` 
--

+ `elif <logical test>:` tests for an additional condition (can have an unlimited number)
--

+ `else:` optional default if none of the other tests are true
--

```python
temp = 25
if temp < 30:
        print("It's really cold!")
elif temp < 65:
        print("It's cold!")
elif temp > 100:
        print("It's really hot")
elif temp > 85:
        print("It's hot!")
else:
        print("The temperature is fine")
```
---

#Conditional statement in Python (selection)
+ Notice the execution of the `if`, `elif`, `else` is going to stop once a condition is met and the sequence will continue
```python
temp = 25
if temp < 30:
        print("It's really cold!")
elif temp < 65:
        print("It's cold!")
elif temp > 100:
        print("It's really hot")
elif temp > 85:
        print("It's hot!")
else:
        print("The temperature is fine")
```

---

#Conditional statement in Python (selection)
+ This will have a very different result
```python
temp = 25
if temp < 30:
        print("It's really cold!")
if temp < 65:
        print("It's cold!")
if temp > 100:
        print("It's really hot")
if temp > 85:
        print("It's hot!")
else:
        print("The temperature is fine")
```

---

#For Loops (iteration)
--

+ Loops through a set sequence of values
--

+ Assign a temporary variable that takes on the element from the sequence
--

+ Temporary variable used within the body of the loop
--

+ Temporary variable is reassigned with next value from sequence
--

```python
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
        print(w)
```

---

#While Loops (iteration)
+ Loops until a guard condition is met
--

```python
n = 0
while n < 5:
        n += 1
print(n)
```
--

+ What happens if I forgot the `n += 1`?
--

![img-center-70](http://i.giphy.com/HPASxeEylfHA4.gif)

---

#While Loops (iteration)
+ Use when the number of iterations is unknown
--

+ Helps ensure a condition or variable state is achieved before moving on with code execution

#Study of Algorithms
--

+ Design of an algorithm
--

+ Validation of an algorithm
--

+ Analysis of an algorithm
--

+ Test of an algorithm

--

##A "real" algorithms class would focus on each of these things intensely
--

##We won't be doing that

---

class:center,middle
#Design of an algorithm

---

#Pseudocode
--

+ An informal, high-level description of a process
--

+ Describes the flow of an operation
--

+ Similar to actual code
--

+ Focus is on the execution rather than syntax
--

+ Can create your own pseudocode style

---

#Pseudocode example

```
function grader
    If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
        print "passed"
    else
        print "failed"
```

--

##Notice this looks a lot like Python
```python
def grader(students_grade):
    if students_grade >= 60:
        print("passed")
    else:
        print("failed")
```

---

##How would we describe multi-digit addition in pseudocode?

---

class:center,middle
#Let's write some more algorithms 
#(in pseudocode)

---

#Sort
--

+ Input: a list of integer values
--

+ Operation: sort the list
--

+ Output: a sorted list of values
--

+ _Note: Don't worry about checking data types, assume they'll always be integers but design for other error conditions_

---

#Search
--

+ Input: a sorted list and a search term
--

+ Operation: find the element in the list
--

+ Output: the location of the item in the list or indicate if it's not there

---

#Validating an algorithm
--

+ Ensure algorithm computes correct answer for all legal inputs
--

+ Usually a mathematical process involving some proof of correctness
--

+ Called "program proving" or "program verification"
--

+ It ensures the logic is correct
--

+ Why is this important?

---

#Analyzing an algorithm
--

+ Determine how much computing space and computing time an algorithm will take for a given number of inputs
--

+ More inputs require more space and time to compute
--

+ The design of the operation will increase the complexity
--

+ We can estimate beforehand or test afterward
--

+ In some cases it's better to estimate than test

---

#Estimating space complexity
--

+ Variables, functions, and objects take up space in memory
--

+ Memory size varies by the type (Python handles for you)
--


```
Bytes  type        empty + scaling notes
24     int         NA
28     long        NA
37     str         + 1 byte per additional character
52     unicode     + 4 bytes per additional character
56     tuple       + 8 bytes per additional item
72     list        + 32 for first, 8 for each additional
232    set         sixth item increases to 744; 22nd, 2280; 86th, 8424
280    dict        sixth item increases to 1048; 22nd, 3352; 86th, 12568
64     class inst  has a __dict__ attr, same scaling as dict above
16     __slots__   class with slots has no dict, seems to store in 
                   mutable tuple-like structure.
120    func def    doesn't include default args and other attrs
904    class def   has a proxy __dict__ structure for class attrs
104    old class   makes sense, less stuff, has real dict though.
```

#Estimating space complexity
--

+ In general, reducing the space complexity of an algorithm will decrease run time
--

+ In most cases, this isn't important given the state of technology
--

+ Becomes clear when you get to larger scales

---

#Estimating time complexity
+ What is the time complexity of this?

```python
#takes in a list of numbers (a) and sums them together
def sum(a):
    sum = 0
    for n in a:
        sum += n
    return sum
```

---

#Estimating time complexity
+ What about the time complexity of this?
```python
#takes in a list of numbers (a) and multiplies each
# element by the other elements in the list
#assigns that value to the original position in the list
def multiply_list_element(a):
        for i in range(a):
            sum = 0
            for j in range(a):
                if i != j:
                    sum += a[i] * a[j]
            a[i] = sum
```

---

#Estimating time complexity
+ We can estimate the worst-case, best-case, or average-case
--

+ We generally use the average-case (called Big-O)
--

+ We can then compare based on the average case for a given input size

#Analysis of Algorithms

>###People who analyze algorithms have double happiness. First of all they experience the sheer beauty of elegant mathematical patterns that surround elegant computational procedures. Then they receive a practical payoff when their theories make it possible to get other jobs done more quickly and more economically.

#Test of an algorithm

+ Debugging to make sure it works properly

> ###-E. Dijkstra

---

#Key Takeaways
--

+ There will come a point when you need to be more thoughtful in your code
--

+ Use pseudocode or other means to think through the operation you want to accomplish
--

+ Try to minimize the number of variables and operations you're conducting to reduce complexity
--

+ Just because it runs, it doesn't mean it's correct
--

+ Test and verify before going into production (whatever that means for you)
