Brief biography

I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio and have an bachelor's in English from
Ohio Stat. Go Buckeyes, Cavs, Indians, and Browns, in that order.

I did five years in the Army, spending most of my time there either at DLI or
at Hunter AAF in Savannah, GA.

Most of my background in computer stuff is in hardware. I'm here to fix that
and probably do a Master's to chase some dreams.
