#Let's get started

#Discussion
##In groups of 4-5, discuss the following questions:
+ What is an algorithm?
+ Why are they important?
+ Why are we studying them in this class?

##Write out the major themes that come up in your discussion on the Post-It notes provided and we’ll discuss as a class

---

#What is an Algorithm?
--

+ A precise set of instructions required to accomplish a task
--

+ Comprised of three components: Inputs, Operation, Output
--

+ Each step in the operation must be clearly defined and work the same with any input

class:middle,center
#We often write algorithms in functions
##So what's a function?

---

#Functions
--

+ Block of organized, reusable code
--

+ Ideally perform a single action
--

+ Make your code more modular

---

#When do I write a function?
--

+ If you find yourself repeating the same code sequence, it’s time to write a function
--

+ [**D**on’t **R**epeat **Y**ourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
--

+ Helps make your code more readable and easier to maintain

---

#Function Example
+ Try this

```python
def add(x,y):
  return x + y
```

#Let's review some things about Python

---

class:middle,center
#Data structures

---

#What is a data structure?
--

+ A way of organizing data in a computer program
--

+ The method of organizing data differs across types, allowing for different applications
--

+ Important to use the right data structure for the proper task

---

#Algorithms and Data Structures
![img-center-90](../images/algo_ds.png)

---

class:center,middle
#Data structures in Python
##How many can you name?

---

#Lists
--

+ The most versatile data structure in Python
--

+ Can contain multiple data types
--

+ Can be sliced or added to
--

+ Are mutable (can be changed)
--

+ Access individual items by index

--

![img-center-40](../images/list1.png)

---

#List functions
--

+ append(_object_) - add object to list
--

+ extend(_list_) - extend original list with elements of specified in list
--

+ insert(_index, object_) - insert object at specified index
--

+ pop(_[index]_) - pop element from list at index and return (default to last value in list)
--

+ remove(_value_) - delete first occurrence of value from list (no return)

---

#List functions
+ reverse - reverse the order of the list in place
--

+ sort() - sort the list
--

+ count(_value_) - count number of occurrences of value
--

+ index(_value_) - find index of first value and return 

--

##For more information, see [the documentation ](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#list)

---

#When to use a list
--

+ When order matters
--

+ When you can look up the value using a simple numerical index
--

+ When your data might be changed, removed, or extended
--

+ When your data doesn’t need to be unique

---

#Sets
--

+ An unordered collection with no duplicate values
--

+ Created using the keyword “set”
--

+ More limited in the types of objects that can be included (must be hashable, no lists)

--

![img-center-55](../images/set1.png)

---

#When to use sets
--

+ When you only need unique values
--

+ When the data types you’re working with are relatively basic (hashable)
--

+ When your data changes
--

+ When you need to manipulate your sets mathematically (set supports operations like union, intersection, difference, etc)

---

#Tuples
--

+ Immutable (unchangable) data structure similar to a list
--

+ Can contain elements of different types (don’t need to be hashable)

--

![img-center-60](../images/tuple1.png)

---

#When to use tuples
--

+ When your data doesn’t change
--

+ When performance is important (tuples provide better performance because of their immutability)

---

#Dictionaries
--

+ Stores data in key-value pairs
--

+ Provides lookup based on custom keys (instead of numerical indexes)
--

+ Keys must be unique

--

![img-center-100](../images/dict1.png)

---

#When to use a dictionary
--

+ When you need to lookup values by a custom key
--

+ When you need a fast way to lookup values
--

+ When your data needs to be modified

---

#Things to remember with a dictionary
--

+ Key-value pairs aren’t stored in order (use `collections.OrderedDict` if you need to key order is important)
--

+ `collections.defaultdict` is a more flexible implementation for creating a dictionary and adding values

--

#Assignments

---

class:center,middle
#[Submitting Code Assignments](../tutorials/github_submit.html)

---

#Do Now
+ Fork the [repository](https://github.com/ledeprogram/algorithms)
+ Clone the repository onto your local machine (`git clone`)
+ Commit a brief biography of yourself as assignment 0 (text file)
+ Do a pull request to submit

---

#Assignment 1
+ Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and outputs the mean of the numbers using the formula for mean. Do this without any built-in functions like `sum()`, `len()`, and, of course, `mean()`

![img-center-90](../images/mean_form.png)

---

#Assignment 2
+ Create your own version of the [Mayoral Excuse Machine](http://dnain.fo/1CCHKmI) in Python that takes in a name and location, selects an excuse at random and prints an excuse (“Sorry, Richard, I was late to City Hall to meet you, I had a very rough night and woke up sluggish”)
+ Use the “[excuses.csv](homework/data/excuse.csv)” in the Github repository
+ Extra credit if you print the link to the story as well

---

#Assignment 3
+ Modify the code below ([in the repository](homework/Exercise3.ipynb)) that prints every prime number between 1 and 100 to only print every other prime number
+ Extra credit if you can modify the code to speed it up

```python
for num in range(1,101):
    prime = True
    for i in range(2,num):
        if (num%i==0):
            prime = False
    if prime:
        print(num)
```

---

#Assignment 4
+ The code in [Exercise4.ipynb](homework/Exercise4.ipynb) is meant to search for New York Times articles on gay marriage and look at the mean and median word count, but the code has some problems
+ Follow the instructions in the notebook to fix the code and submit your fixed code

---

#Assignment 5
+ React to today's class in a short paragraph and email it to [me](mailto:rad2184[at]columbia[dot]edu?subject=Assignment5)
+ Include what you learned today and what topics you look forward to in the class
+ Include any additional information you feel I should know about yourself and your experience in this program so far
