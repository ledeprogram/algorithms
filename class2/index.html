#Can we start branching in assignments?

---

class:center,middle
#Let's talk about the assignments

---

#Problems with submitting assignments
--

+ Not following the naming convention (`<last>_<first>_<class>_<assign>.ipynb`)
--

+ Committing files you shouldn't have (only `git add` the files you want updated)
--

+ Overwriting the Exercise files (don't do that)
--

+ Trying to merge with the wrong branch (should be gh-pages)

---

#Changes I made
--

+ Updated the [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/ledeprogram/algorithms/blob/gh-pages/.gitignore)
--

<<<<<<< HEAD
+ Revised the [Github tutorial](tutorials/github_submit.html)
=======
+ Revised the [Github tutorial](../tutorials/github_submit.html)
>>>>>>> upstream/gh-pages
--

+ Anything else?

---

#Assignment 1
+ Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and outputs the mean of the numbers using the formula for mean. Do this without any built-in functions like `sum()`, `len()`, and, of course, `mean()`

![img-center-90](../images/mean_form.png)

---

#Assignment 2
+ Create your own version of the [Mayoral Excuse Machine](http://dnain.fo/1CCHKmI) in Python that takes in a name and location, selects an excuse at random and prints an excuse (“Sorry, Richard, I was late to City Hall to meet you, I had a very rough night and woke up sluggish”)
+ Use the “[excuses.csv](homework/data/excuse.csv)” in the Github repository
+ Extra credit if you print the link to the story as well

---

#Assignment 3
+ Modify the code below ([in the repository](homework/Exercise3.ipynb)) that prints every prime number between 1 and 100 to only print every other prime number
+ Extra credit if you can modify the code to speed it up

```python
for num in range(1,101):
    prime = True
    for i in range(2,num):
        if (num%i==0):
            prime = False
    if prime:
        print(num)
```

---

#Assignment 4
+ The code in [Exercise4.ipynb](homework/Exercise4.ipynb) is meant to search for New York Times articles on gay marriage and look at the mean and median word count, but the code has some problems
+ Follow the instructions in the notebook to fix the code and submit your fixed code

#Data Structures Redux

---

#Sets
--

+ An unordered collection with no duplicate values
--

+ Created using the keyword “set”
--

+ More limited in the types of objects that can be included (stick with basic types)
--

+ Think of it like a bag of things you toss values into without needing to get them out in any order

--

```python
s = set("lede algorithms")
print(s)
{'m', 'o', 'i', 'd', 'r', 's', 'z', 'a', 'g', 'l', ' ', 'e', 't', 'h'}
```

---

#When to use sets
--

+ When you only need unique values
--

+ When the data types you’re working with are relatively basic (hashable)
--

+ When your data changes
--

+ When you need to manipulate your sets mathematically (set supports operations like union, intersection, difference, etc)

---

#Set example
```python
s = set("lede algorithms")
print(s)
{'m', 'o', 'i', 'd', 'r', 's', 'z', 'a', 'g', 'l', ' ', 'e', 't', 'h'}

c = set("columbia")
print(c)
{'a', 'b', 'c', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'u'}

print(c - s)
{'c', 'b', 'u'}
```

---

#Set functions
--

+ `add(value)` - adds value to set
--

+ `remove(value)` - removes the value; if not present raises key error
--

+ `discard(value)` - discards the value if present in the set
--

+ `pop()` - removes an arbitrary set element
--

+ use `for` loop to access all the elements (can't index)

---

#Control Flow

---

#Control Statements
--

+ Manages order of program operation
--

+ Helps program make a decision based on conditions
--

+ Any computable operation can be replicated with a mix of three control statements (sequence, selection, and iteration)

---

#Sequence
--

+ The order of functions in a program
--

+ Most basic form of control flow
--

+ Basically the thing you've been doing this whole time

---

#Conditional statement (selection)
--

+ Code block only executes if some logical test is met
--

+ Logical test can be as simple or complex as necessary
--

+ Uses [Boolean logic](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex28.html)

---

#Conditional statement in Python (selection)

+ `if <logical test>:` code executes only if the logical test is `True` 
--

+ `elif <logical test>:` tests for an additional condition (can have an unlimited number)
--

+ `else:` optional default if none of the other tests are true
--

```python
temp = 70
if temp < 30:
        print("It's really cold!")
elif temp < 65:
        print("It's cold!")
elif temp > 100:
        print("It's really hot")
elif temp > 85:
        print("It's hot!")
else:
        print("The temperature is fine")
```
---

#Conditional statement in Python (selection)
+ Notice the execution of the `if`, `elif`, `else` is going to stop once a condition is met and the sequence will continue
```python
temp = 70
if temp < 30:
        print("It's really cold!")
elif temp < 65:
        print("It's cold!")
elif temp > 100:
        print("It's really hot")
elif temp > 85:
        print("It's hot!")
else:
        print("The temperature is fine")
```

---

#For Loops (iteration)
--

+ Loops through a set sequence of values
--

+ Assign a temporary variable that takes on the element from the sequence
--

+ Temporary variable used within the body of the loop
--

+ Temporary variable is reassigned with next value from sequence
--

```python
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
        print(w)
```

---

#While Loops (iteration)
+ Loops until a guard condition is met
--

```python
n = 0
while n < 5:
        n += 1
print(n)
```
--

+ What happens if I forgot the `n += 1`?
--

![img-center-70](http://i.giphy.com/HPASxeEylfHA4.gif)

---

#While Loops (iteration)
+ Use when the number of iterations is unknown
--

+ Helps ensure a condition or variable state is achieved before moving on with code execution

#Study of Algorithms
--

+ Design of an algorithm
--

+ Validation of an algorithm
--

+ Analysis of an algorithm
--

+ Test of an algorithm

--

##A "real" algorithms class would focus on each of these things intensely
--

##We won't be doing that

---

class:center,middle
#Design of an algorithm

---

#Pseudocode
--

+ An informal, high-level description of a process
--

+ Describes the flow of an operation
--

+ Similar to actual code
--

+ Focus is on the execution rather than syntax
--

+ Can create your own pseudocode style

---

#Pseudocode example

```
function grader
    If student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
        print "passed"
    else
        print "failed"
```

--

##Notice this looks a lot like Python
```python
def grader(students_grade):
    if students_grade >= 60:
        print("passed")
    else:
        print("failed")
```

#Let's write some more algorithms

---

#Sort
--

+ Input: a list of values
--

+ Operation: sort the list
--

+ Output: a sorted list of values

---

#Search
--

+ Input: a sorted list and a search term
--

+ Operation: find the element in the list
--

+ Output: the location of the item in the list or indicate if it's not there

---

#Validating an algorithm
--

+ Ensure algorithm computes correct answer for all legal inputs
--

+ Usually a mathematical process involving some proof of correctness
--

+ Called "program proving" or "program verification"
--

+ It ensures the logic is correct
--

+ Why is this important?

---

#Analyzing an algorithm
--

+ Determine how much computing space and computing time an algorithm will take for a given number of inputs
--

+ More inputs require more space and time to compute
--

+ The design of the operation will increase the complexity
--

+ We can estimate beforehand or test afterward
--

+ In some cases it's better to estimate than test

---

#Estimating complexity
+ What is the time complexity of this?

```python
#takes in a list of numbers (a) and sums them together
def sum(a):
    sum = 0
    for n in a:
        sum += n
    return sum
```

---

#Estimating complexity
+ What about the time complexity of this?
```python
#takes in a list of numbers (a) and multiplies each element by the other elements in the list
#assigns that value to the original position in the list
def multiply_list_element(a):
        for i in range(a):
            sum = 0
            for j in range(a):
                if i != j:
                    sum += a[i] * a[j]
            a[i] = sum
```

---

#Estimating complexity
+ We can estimate the worst-case, best-case, or average-case
--

+ We generally use the average-case (called Big-O)
--

+ We can then compare based on the average case for a given input size

#Analysis of Algorithms

>###People who analyze algorithms have double happiness. First of all they experience the sheer beauty of elegant mathematical patterns that surround elegant computational procedures. Then they receive a practical payoff when their theories make it possible to get other jobs done more quickly and more economically.
